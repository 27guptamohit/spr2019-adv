# Introductions

 * What experience do you have with visualization?
 * Do you have any programming experience?
 * What types of data are you really interested in?
 * Bonus: do you do any data collection yourself?

---

## "Advanced Topics" in Visualization

In this class we will:

 * Conduct some light literature review
 * Explore new software frameworks
 * Draw and prototype stuff
 * Talk through design decisions
 * Come up against really hard problems
 * Seek out and find data

## Hisss

In the middle of the table, you will find a game.

Three of us will play this game.

## Hisss - Part Two

There are fifty cards.

Let's explore these cards and what they contain.

On your drawing surface, sketch out what you think the

## Conceptual Framework

How should we evaluate the visualizations we develop and utilize?

 * Degree of Reduction
 * Interpretability
 * "Neutrality"
 * Aesthetics

---

## Prototyping

During this course you will be expected to prototype visualizations quickly,
often utilizing drawing or design tools.

---

## Weather

---

## Zero to Sixty Computational Stuff

During this course we will be utilizing a number of software packages, mostly
written in Python and Javascript.  To that end, we'll have a crash course right
now in:

 * Python and Jupyter Notebooks and Widgets
 * Javascript (specifically vega-lite)
 * Github pages

We'll use weather data from the [Midwest Regional Climate
Center](https://mrcc.illinois.edu/) to get started.

## Next Time

Next time we will start talking about color and using vizualizations that are
exclusively designed for internal comparisons.
