# Course Description

In this seminar-style course we will discuss advanced topics in visualization
techniques.  This will cover topics such as the history of visualization
techniques, the perception and understanding of visual information, and new
frontiers in displaying quantitative information.  We will explore the modern
technical stack for creating and sharing visualizations, including topics in
javascript, python, and reactive frameworks.

## Course Overview

This course will include a number of technical tasks, but will additionally be
focused on the aesthetic and high-level understanding of visualization.
We will discuss in depth new trends in visualization as well as evidence-based
studies of how to develop better visualizations.

Students are expected to have laptops with them, as well as access to Python
installations, and will be encouraged to participate in class.  Homework will
largely be in the form of projects and open-ended assignments.  Class
participation will not determine grades but is expected to guide discussions;
students are expected to participate and share thoughts, ideas, and
suggestions.

## Pre- and Co-requisites

No explicit prerequisites are required.  Students are expected to have taken
standard programming courses.  Students are expected to either be familiar
with, or be prepared to familiarize themselves with, Python, Javascript,
GitHub, and other computational tools.  Haven taken Data Viz (IS590DV) is
optional, but encouraged.

# Land Acknowledgment

As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has
a responsibility to acknowledge the historical context in which it exists. In
order to remind ourselves and our community, we will begin this event with the
following statement. We are currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia,
Peankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi,
Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these
Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an
institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community inclusive
of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our efforts.

[More information can be found on the Chancellor's
Website.](https://chancellor.illinois.edu/land_acknowledgement.html)

# Course Overview

The central themes of the course are:

1. What are currently-understood best practices for constructing meaningful and
   beautiful visualizations?
2. What is the "cutting edge" of software stacks for visualization?
3. What theoretical approaches to visualization can we utilize to improve our
   ability to understand data?

# Course Materials

There is no textbook for this course.  All course materials will be posted to
the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2019-adv/

As the course progresses, a list of recommended readings will be generated for
each class.  These will be included in the course materials repository, and
students are encouraged to fork that repository and issue pull requests to add
suggested readings.

# About your instructor

Matthew Turk is an Assistant Professor at the School of Information Sciences.
His training was in Astronomy, where he conducted simulations of the formation
of the first stars in the Universe.  This led him to work on developing
an analysis and visualization package for volumetric data, 
[yt](http://yt-project.org/), which has been used for quantiative and
qualitative visualization of data from several disciplines.

# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

# Statement of Inclusion

[Inclusive Illinois Committee Diversity Statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/supporting_docs/Inclusive%20Illinois%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf)

As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.

# Accessibility Statement
To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon
as possible.  To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St.,
Champaign, call (217) 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to
disability@illinois.edu.

# Assignments and Evaluation

Students will be graded based on a combination of assignments (30%), class
presentations (30%) and a final project (40%).  The final project will be a
capstone to the course.

Assignments in this course will be a mixture of coding/visualization work and
written (or drawn) work.  These two may not be distinct assignments; students
will be asked to describe their code and justify choices for making decisions
with respect to visualizations.

Students are expected, unless otherwise instructed, to be the principal authors
of their code.  This does not mean they may not investigate resources such as
StackOverflow, package documentation, etc; however, they *must* cite when
resources (especially StackOverflow and other "recipe" sites) are utilized.

The submission process for homeworks will be described by example during class
before any homeworks are to be submitted.

Each assignment will be 50% "correctness" and 50% the narrative description of
the process.  "Correctness" in this case indicates that the code runs without
issue, results are produced, and each component of the assignment is completed.
The narrative description of the process will be graded on grammar and
completeness.

### Grading Policy

All assignments are required for all students. Completing all assignments is
not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must be completed in order to
pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit
unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).

**Grading Scale:**

| 94-100 = A
| 90-93 = A-
| 87-89 = B+
| 83-86 = B
| 80-82 = B-
| 77-79 = C+
| 73-76 = C
| 70-72 = C-
| 67-69 = D+
| 63-66 = D
| 60-62 = D-
| 59 and below = F

### Incompletes

Students must request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor
and student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework and the
student must file an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and
the student’s academic advisor with the School’s records representative. More
information on incompletes is available here:
<http://webdocs.ischool.illinois.edu/registration/incomplete_grade_form.pdf>

### Late Assignments

Students are required to attend each class, and if they are unable to do so
much notify the instructor and TA in advance and request an excused absence.
Participation in class -- in the form of comments, questions, and discussion --
is expected.

## Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you – we have three options: Run, hide or
fight.


### Run

Leaving the area quickly is the best option if it is safe to do so.

- Take time now to learn the different ways to leave your building.
- Leave personal items behind.
- Assist those who need help, but consider whether doing so puts
  yourself at risk.
- Alert authorities of the emergency when it is safe to do so.

### Hide

When you can’t or don’t want to run, take shelter indoors.

- Take time now to learn different ways to seek shelter in your building.
- If severe weather is imminent, go to the nearest indoor storm refuge area.
- If someone is trying to hurt you and you can’t evacuate, get to a place
  where you can’t be seen, lock or barricade your area, silence your
  phone, don’t make any noise and don’t come out until you receive an
  Illini-Alert indicating it is safe to do so.

### Fight

As a last resort, you may need to fight to increase your chances of
survival.

- Think about what kind of common items are in your area which you
  can use to defend yourself.
- Team up with others to fight if the situation allows.
- Mentally prepare yourself – you may be in a fight for your life.

Please be aware of persons with disabilities who may need additional
assistance in emergency situations.
